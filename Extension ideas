If youâ€™d like to challenge yourself further, you could consider the following:

- Use different credit card numbers from a credit card number generator and validator site and test if your functions work for all types of credit cards.
- To make it easier to test credit card numbers, create a function that accepts a string and converts it into an array of numbers like the initially provided arrays. (Check the hint for a helpful function)
- Create a function that will convert invalid numbers into valid numbers.

Hint
If you need to convert strings to numbers, parseInt() can help you do that.
